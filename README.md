#Discrete Solver

Hello, this is a simple project which objective is to try solving more than one [Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) environment without making changes to the code. 

To this moment it only runs in discrete time environment where state and actions are passed to the users as parameters instead of pixels.

So far I was able to solve CartPole-v0, CartPole-v1 and MountainCar-v0. Acrobot also had good results but I wasn't able to find what is require to consider it solved.

I tried to solve LunarLander-v2, but until this moment I had no sucess with this code.
